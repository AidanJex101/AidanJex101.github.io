          <h3>Into The Unknown</h3>

          <p>It was supposed to be exquisite<br>
          it's quite the opposite<br>
          Was I meant to only imagine<br>
          Watch me while I fight this dragon<br>
          <br>
          I fight the beast<br>
          I just wanted to celebrate with a feast<br>
          Couldn't you have loved me at least?<br>
          Maybe not, it's just another crease<br>
          <br>
          I realized what I wanted a little late<br>
          I was so sure of my fate<br>
          It all felt so innate<br>
          I didn't notice what I could create<br>
          <br>
          Let this be a test<br>
          Its only for the best<br>
          Let me strike my match<br>
          Hopping right into the hatch<br>
          <br>
          Through the smoke<br>
          Through the flames<br>
          We will likely choke<br>
          These aren’t just games<br>
          <br>
          The truth is the truth<br>
          A promise is a promise<br>
          I would lose every tooth<br>
          I feel so helpless<br>
          <br>
          I couldnt have what I wanted even if I tried<br>
          I couldnt pretend all I would do is have lied<br>
          The feelings are overwhelming<br>
          Your just so compelling<br>
          <br>
          You probably wouldnt believe me<br>
          Let me just hide behind this tree<br>
          So far away … So far away<br>
          Even if we got closer<br>
          Would you love me anyway?<br>
          Would you let me just smoulder?<br>
          <br>
          I couldnt possibly allow you in<br>
          Its already September<br>
          The flames will always remember<br>
          Will you?<br>
          <br>
      </p>

          <h3>The Jury</h3>

          <p>
              It hit me once, it hit me twice<br>
              It felt as cold as ice<br>
              It felt surreal<br>
              Are you just a poltergeist?<br>
              <br>
              I have forgotten objectivity<br>
              I have only gained more sensitivity<br>
              The jury was once enclosed<br>
              Its been more then merely exposed<br>
              <br>
              You’ll never understand the longevity<br>
              It doesnt even lead to prosperity<br>
              I miss you already<br>
              I feel unsteady<br>
              <br>
              What is the truth anyways?<br>
              Just a set of lies I left for myself?<br>
              Let me paraphrase<br>
              Leaving it by itself<br>
              <br>
              It wasnt you<br>
              It certainly wasnt me<br>
              Was I doing something wrong?<br>
              Please, just one song<br>
              <br>
              The truth was comforting<br>
              The lies just as much<br>
              Its one or the other<br>
              I couldnt make you bother<br>
              <br>
              You could tell me everything<br>
              I have my own jury<br>
              I love you more then anything<br>
              Please, dont leave in a hurry<br>
              <br>
              Your too good at keeping yourself at bay<br>
              I wish I could just go to sleep and call it a day<br>
              You didnt expect it to happen<br>
              Oh, but the passion!<br>
              <br>
              I couldnt possibly be guilty<br>
              I bet your so pretty<br>
              Welcome to my mind<br>
              Leave the verdict behind<br>
              <br>
              I cant expect you to paraphrase this one<br>
              The questions you have posed<br>
              Welcome to the weight of a ton<br>
              Case closed<br>
              <br>

          <h3>The insufferable</h3>
          <p>
              Welcome to the electric chair<br>
              Who decided this was fair?<br>
              I never thought this could be me<br>
              They’ll let you leave for a small fee<br>
              <br>
              I wondered what i needed to do to leave<br>
              I had to do something I couldnt believe<br>
              I didn't know if i could manage<br>
              Always at a disadvantage<br>
              <br>
              I’ve become fond of this chair<br>
              Leaving feelings in the air<br>
              Its hard to leave the chair alone<br>
              Especially if you give up everything you own<br>
              <br>
              I didnt matter what I wanted anyway<br>
              I was being forced to learn to enjoy<br>
              Get lost and find myself carried away<br>
              Finally remembering this was all a ploy<br>
              <br>
              I became one with the chair<br>
              What a careless affair<br>
              The small fee was nothing but small<br>
              It wasnt even a they at all<br>
              <br>
              It was me who binded myself<br>
              Me who was allowing the electrocution<br>
              I could have left at any moment<br>
              Swallowed in my own extortion<br>
              <br>
              My thoughts almost like a void<br>
              A situation I thought I could avoid<br>
              Thats when the anxiety came<br>
              Nobody but me to blame<br>
              <br>
              I think I finally learned<br>
              Today’s the day I dont get burned<br>
              I stand up, I walk away<br>
              I see my trophies, all on display<br>
              <br>
              I tried to resist turning around<br>
              It felt like I was about to drown<br>
              I screamed from the terror<br>
              Screaming had been my gravest error<br>
              <br>
              I had awoken from a dream<br>
              Still in this chair from a scheme<br>
              I’ll never learn to stop being vulnerable<br>
              Welcome to being part of the insufferable<br>
              <br>

          <h3>Inquiry</h3><br>
          <p> I have asked many questions<br>
              I have heard several suggestions<br>
              Nothing feels appealing<br>
              I cant shake this feeling<br>
              <br>
              Everyone wants to say they know<br>
              Can't they just let me grow?<br>
              Everyday another headache<br>
              Do they know whats at stake?<br>
              <br>
              I can’t believe in something I have never seen<br>
              Nothing could ever be so obscene<br>
              I yearn for knowledge<br>
              Something no one is willing to acknowledge<br>
              <br>
              Heres yet another morning<br>
              Another day with seemingly no warning<br>
              Everything I have to look forward<br>
              Lets just fast-forward<br>
              <br>
              Death crossing my mind<br>
              I just feel so blind<br>
              Where are my eyes?<br>
              All I see are lies<br>
              <br>
              I start jumping to conclusions<br>
              Was it at all just delusions?<br>
              Well what do you suppose?<br>
              Would this be what I chose?<br>
              <br>
              These are just emotions<br>
              Something as beautiful as oceans<br>
              Just going through the motions<br>
              Waves hitting the side with no real notions<br>
              <br>
              I just want to be a best friend<br>
              A chess player<br>
              This cant be the end<br>
              Just another layer<br>
              <br>
              Was this anxiety talking?<br>
              My thoughts are dying<br>
              The grime reaper came knocking<br>
              Its just another funeral, no crying<br>
              <br>
              The questions dont stop coming<br>
              The emotions dont stop flowing<br>
              I hope I dont stop becoming<br>
              Ill just carry on not knowing<br>
              <br>
          </p>

          <h3>Revolução</h3>
          <P>
          I wave my stick of fire<br>
          This is the pitchfork of no tire<br>
          People run, people scream<br>
          People who once were a team<br>
          <br>
          This was their last chance<br>
          Welcome to the fire dance<br>
          Buildings crumble all around<br>
          Nothing but dust to be found<br>
          <br>
          He watched as they came<br>
          This was the royal crown<br>
          He once had fame<br>
          They left nothing but a frown<br>
          <br>
          They stopped and looked<br>
          This couldnt be the end<br>
          City was cooked<br>
          Nothing but fear to lend<br>
          <br>
          The crown didnt exist<br>
          Simply an illusion<br>
          They were being greedy<br>
          Only a diversion<br>
          <br>
          He was what they wanted to become<br>
          A whole hand but they only had a thumb<br>
          Sudden realization left them numb<br>
          How could they have been so dumb?<br>
          <br>
          Their city in shambles<br>
          At once they began to rebuild<br>
          In their mouths, nothing but rambles<br>
          The trance of the many skilled<br>
          <br>
          They had no king at all<br>
          For they didnt need one<br>
          The buildings so tall<br>
          They could finally see the sun<br>
          <br>
          Many with hands they couldnt use before<br>
          Understanding their happiness is impossible<br>
          The amount they had to rigor<br>
          Learning this lesson was probable<br>
          <br>
          This was the city above<br>
          Who are these men anyway?<br>
          The revolution of love<br>
          The people who were castaway<br>
          <br>
          </P>

          <h3>Just Yesterday</h3><br>
          <p>
              Who is that standing there?<br>
              Look at me, sitting in this chair<br>
              I thought i had improved<br>
              See? Nobody approves<br>
              <br>
              I remember a time of puppets<br>
              People pretending with all their trumpets<br>
              Fantastic music,  the marvelous dance<br>
              People hiding, what are we without the trance?<br>
              <br>
              Somehow the strings got loose<br>
              The facade had been lifted<br>
              I could finally see all abuse<br>
              My whole life had been shifted<br>
              <br>
              My eyes like a box of photos<br>
              How long had I been blind?<br>
              Is this a life I had chose?<br>
              Was I the only one in this bind?<br>
              <br>
              Ignorance is bliss<br>
              Then why do I feel so scared?<br>
              Do they understand this?<br>
              I couldnt have been more unprepared<br>
              <br>
              I tried to forget<br>
              I tried to move forward<br>
              All i feel is regret<br>
              Did you give me your word?<br>
              <br>
              Today is a time of renewal<br>
              As fine as any jewel<br>
              Easy to break<br>
              Sometimes fake<br>
              <br>
              Can we get through the past?<br>
              Wait, not so fast<br>
              I feel a pull on my shoulders<br>
              The strength of boulders<br>
              <br>
              Is this what they meant?<br>
              I couldve swore I was warned<br>
              This is the truth completly bent<br>
              Let the emotions continue to be churned<br>
              <br>
              So I begin to dance<br>
              This will be my last chance<br>
              There just isnt a better way<br>
              Just Yesterday<br>

            <h3>Testing Testing 1, 2, 3</h3><br>
            <p> 
              Come on over and sit down<br>
              Let me pour you a drink<br>
              Don’t look at the glass as I pour<br>
              Its not what you think<br>
              <br>
              With your mind you can change its contents<br>
              Anything your heart desires<br>
              Careful or it might shatter<br>
              Did I mean your heart or the glass?<br>
              <br>
              You want a glass of water you say?<br>
              How about ice?<br>
              They think its for you<br>
              Let them see with their eyes<br>
              <br>
              They say you can wish for anything<br>
              Doesnt mean youll get everything<br>
              You must choose<br>
              Just the water or just the ice<br>

              They were supposed to be together<br>
              Perhaps wish for something else<br>
              Attempt to take a drink<br>
              Watch as I make the ice cubes shrink<br>
              <br>
              Looks like you had no choice at all<br>
              The ice was required to dissipate <br>
              Next the water<br>
              It will now evaporate<br>
              <br>
              Why so blue?<br>
              The glass is hanging from the ceiling<br>
              Look at the rope, so thin<br>
              You can’t seem to shake this feeling<br>
              <br>
              Let this be the last<br>
              The last time you fill the glass<br>
              Or it might be your last<br>
              Perhaps not so fast<br>
              <br>
              The glass is strong<br>
              Why not let it fall?<br>
              Have you given it a shot?<br>
              Is it even your call?<br>
              <br>
              You can’t let these feelings take control<br>
              Why even take the risk?<br>
              You love your ice water?<br>
              So silly.<br>
              <br>
              You failed your test<br>
              Please exit your seat<br>
              The glass isnt even real<br>
              Just accept this is no remarkable feat<br>
